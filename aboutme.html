        I am from France<img

        So my direct and straightforwardness can be misunderstood at times
        because in France when we disagree with someone, we tend to debate in order to better understand
        each other's logic but in a lot of anglophone countries that can cause misunderstandings 
        and gets looked as "complaining","arguing", "fighting" and etc but we are just passionate people.

      <h3>Why I love to travel?</h3>
      <p>It's the best way to make yourself uncomfortable and get out of your comfort zone. Like when I came to Canada, 
        just playing football was complicated because I could understand some English but expressing myself was complicated
        and I had to get out of my comfort zone so I can learn from every interaction I had. So to me travelling is a bit the same 
        but I used to be someone that travelled with friends a couple a years ago but then
        I realised that solo travelling is way better because:
      <ul>
        <li>You are forced to integrate into the culture and learn the language, foods, lifestyles and etc</li>
        <li>Make new connections with other solo travellers</li>
        <li>You have more of a freedom because you are not organising with travelling partner or group</li>
        <li>Can stay for however long you want</li>
        <li>And much more!</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Which country is my favourite?</h3>

        In fact! the background for this website is from when I was at a beach in Cartagena, Colombia watching the sunset. 
        Actually! how I got to Cartagena was kind of random and last minute...really last minute..I called and got my flight at 04h00 and by 06h00, I was at the airport waiting for my flight😅
        because one of my friend's came to stay with me in Medellin, Colombia and he had a friend
        that was in Carthagena,Colombia so he asked me "if I wanted to go there for a week?" while we were out and I was like "bon...why not". It was one of those plans that you make
        during a night out and then you ask yourself after you sleep "I really did this..."🤣.
        It ended up being one of the highlights of my almost 1 year stay in Colombia because of the island hopping, funny moments, dining and more.
